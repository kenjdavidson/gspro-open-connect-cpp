##  Contribution

I'm not a C++ developer, so chances are this is missing things that could pose problems (memory management, etc), but I've worked through creating
this library using the same logic that I feel would make it the most usable with a number of application.

1. Clone the repository
2. Branch to a meaningful name
3. Complete changes and tests
4. Open a Pull Request (with details)

> Step 3 should include things like documentation, sample application, etc based on the changes made.
